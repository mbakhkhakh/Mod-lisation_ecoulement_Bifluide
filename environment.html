        <h2>The NEOS Library</h2>
        <p> This following work is based on NEOS, a C++ coded library developed by the Inria
            MEMPHIS team. NEOS is designed with various differential operators discretized by
            finite volumes on quadtree meshes in 2D (and octrees in 3D). Additionally, NEOS is
            capable of massively parallel computing using MPI.
        </p>

        <h2>The Quadtree Meshes</h2>
        <p> The quadtree is a highly efficient structure that operates on the principle of recursive
            spatial subdivision, which involves breaking down a space into smaller, more
            manageable units for analysis. At the heart of its design, each node in a quadtree
            represents a specific spatial region. This region is then subdivided into four smaller
            regions, allowing for more detailed analysis and efficient data retrieval. One of the
            key properties of a quadtree is its spatial indexing capability, which, combined with its
            adaptability to various scales of spatial data, makes it an invaluable tool in areas
            such as geographic information systems, image processing, and computer graphics.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Advantages of Quadtree Meshes</h2>
        <p> Quadtrees are exceptionally useful in simulations due to their ability to provide
            adaptive mesh refinement. This feature allows for increased detail in specific regions
            of interest within a simulation, thus enhancing accuracy where it is most crucial. In
            addition to this, quadtrees facilitate efficient storage and retrieval of spatial data. This
            optimization of computational resources significantly reduces processing time,
            making these structures highly effective. Furthermore, they excel in representing
            complex 2D and 3D geometries, which is essential for accurately modeling physical
            spaces in simulations, thereby ensuring a high level of precision and reliability in the
            simulated environment.
